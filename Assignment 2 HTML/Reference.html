          According to legend, the ancient Olympic Games were founded by
          <a
            href="https://uen.pressbooks.pub/mythologyunbound/chapter/heracles/"
            target="_blank"
            >Heracles</a
          >
          (the Roman Hercules), a son of Zeus. Yet the first Olympic Games for
          which we still have written records were held in <span class = "IText">776 BCE</span> (though it is
          generally believed that the Games had been going on for many years
          already).

            A naked runner named Coroebus won the sole event at these
            Olympics<br />
            called the stade - a run of approximately 192 meters. This made
            Coroebus the very first<br />
            Olympic champion in history.

          The ancient Olympic Games grew and continued to be played every four
          years for nearly 1200 years. In 393 CE, the Roman emperor Theodosius I
          abolished the Games because of their pagan influences.

          Approximately 1500 years later, a Frenchmen named
          <a href="https://olympics.com/ioc/pierre-de-coubertin" target="_blank"
            >Pierre de Coubertin</a
          >
          began their revival. After examining the education of the German,
          British, and American children, Coubertin decided that it was
          exercise, more specifically sports, that made a well-rounded and
          vigorous person.
        </p>
        <p>
          <center>
            <img src="OlyImages/Pierre.jpg" width="300px" height="250px" />
          </center>
        </p>
        <p>
          Coubertin's attempt to get France interested in sports was not met
          with enthusiasm. Still, Coubertin persisted. Coubertin first pitched
          his idea to revive the Olympic Games at a meeting of the Union des
          Sports Athlétiques in Paris on November 25, 1892, Coubertin stated,
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            “Let us export our oarsmen, our runners, our fencers into other
            lands. That is the true Free Trade of the future; and the day it is
            introduced into Europe the cause of Peace will have received a new
            and strong ally. It inspires me to touch upon another step I now
            propose and in it I shall ask that the help you have given me
            hitherto you will extend again, so that together we may attempt to
            realise, upon a basis suitable to the conditions of our modern life,
            the splendid and beneficent task of reviving the Olympic Games.”
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          His speech did not inspire action. Two years later, Coubertin
          organized a meeting with 79 delegates who represented nine countries.
          This time, Coubertin aroused interest. The delegates at the conference
          voted unanimously for the Olympic Games. The delegates also decided to
          have Coubertin construct an international committee to organize the
          Games. This committee became the International Olympic Committee
          (IOC).

          The very first modern Olympic Games opened in the first week of April
          1896. Since the Greek government had been unable to fund construction
          of a stadium, a wealthy Greek architect, Georgios Averoff, donated one
          million drachmas (over $100,000) to restore the Panathenaic Stadium,
          originally built in 330 BC for the Olympic Games.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the Games were not well publicized internationally, contestants
          were not nationally chosen but rather came individually and at their
          own expense. Some contestants were tourists who happened to be in the
          area during the Games. Athletes wore their athletic club uniform
          rather than a national team one.

        <p>
          The Official <u>Olympic Flag</u> was created by de Coubertin in 1914.
          It contains five interconnected rings on a white background. The five
          rings symbolize the five continents and are blue, yellow, black,
          green, and red. The colors were chosen because at least one of them
          appeared on the flag of every country in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Olympic Motto was founded in 1921 by de Coubertin who borrowed a
          Latin phrase from his friend, Father Henri Didon, for the Olympic
          motto: Citius, Altius, Fortius ("Swifter, Higher, Stronger").
        </p>
        <p>
          The Olympic Oath was written by de Coubertin for the athletes to
          recite at each Olympic Games. During the opening ceremonies, one
          athlete recites the oath on behalf of all the athletes. The oath reads
          as follows:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            "In the name of all competitors, I promise that we shall take part
            in these Olympic Games, respecting and abiding by the rules that
            govern them, in the true spirit of sportsmanship, for the glory of
            sport and the honor of our teams."
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>

          The Olympic Flame is lit at the ancient site of Olympia by women
          wearing ancient-style robes and using a curved mirror and the sun. The
          Olympic Torch is passed from runner to runner from the ancient site of
          Olympia to the stadium in the hosting city. The flame is then kept
          alight until the Games have concluded.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Olympic Medals are designed especially for each individual Olympic
          Games by the host city's organizing committee. Each medal must be at
          least three millimeters thick and 60 millimeters in diameter. Also,
          the gold and silver Olympic medals must be made out of 92.5 percent
          silver, with the gold medal covered in six grams of gold.
        </p>
        <p>
          Women were first allowed to participate in 1900 at the second modern
          Olympic Games.
