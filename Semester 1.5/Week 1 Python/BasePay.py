# Description:Write a function that will calculate the gross pay based on a base salary plus 
#commission based on a draw against commission. NOTE â€“ a draw against commission 
#is when an employee does not meet their sales quota and the base salary is deducted 
#based on a percentage under the quota. 
#All employees earn a base salary of $350.00 and have a sales quota of $5,000.00. If 
#their sales are below the quota, calculate 10% of the amount they are under and 
#subtract it from the base salary. If they have exceeded their quota calculate the 
#commission at 4% of sales and add it to their base salary. In addition, if the employee 
#has sales more than $10,000.00 add an extra $200.00 to the gross pay. If the 
#employee has sales more than $20,000.00, add an extra $500.00 to the gross pay.
